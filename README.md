Your pull request will be evaluated by the [Cloudbees Jenkins job](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/plot-plugin/).

a way that they can detect when they run tests.


## Building the Plugin

```bash
  $ java -version # Need Java 1.8, earlier versions are unsupported for build
  $ mvn -version # Need a modern maven version; maven 3.2.5 and 3.5.0 are known to work
  $ mvn clean install
```

```bash
  $ mvn package # produces target/plot.hpi for manual installation 
```

## Running/testing plugin locally

```bash
  $ mvn hpi:run
```

Following command will start fresh Jenkins instance with current plugin installed.
Jenkins will be started on `0.0.0.0:8080` address. Please make sure 8080 port is not in use before running the command.

Alternatively, other port can be specified by adding a parameter:
``` bash
   $ mvn hpi:run -Djetty.port=8090
```
