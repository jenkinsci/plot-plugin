  The file must contain a <code>YVALUE</code> property and may optionally contain a

  <p>
  The specification of this file can use wildcards like <code>build/report/*/report.properties</code>
  but only the first file resolved by the wildcard will be used.

  the @includes of Ant fileset</a> for the exact format.
